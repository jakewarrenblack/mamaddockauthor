    "content": "Asking an Irish person to write a 'few' words about themselves is, putting it mildly, almost impossible! But, here goes. My name is Miriam and I was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. I'm lucky to live near the sea as well as my local historical park (St. Anne's, Raheny/Clontarf) where I love to go for long walks with my dog, Sherlock—one very clever Beagle (seriously, it's like living with Einstein!).\n\nHaving dabbled in other 'interests' over the years (I won't bore you), in the background, however, I was always an avid reader, with words constantly floating around in my mind yet doing nothing about them—in a literary sense. I used to always say, 'One day, I'll write that book!' But never seemed to get around to doing it. I think the mere thought of putting those words—along with my imagination—to literary use, was daunting, therefore, always putting it off. That is, until 2011 when I finally took the plunge and picked up that pen and notebook (still have them, too!). I began to string those words into sentences, then paragraphs, then pages, eventually joining them together to create my first novel—The Sixth Amulet - Book One. Then my imagination had other plans; it didn't want to stop at just one. Why would it? And so, one novel turned into two, then three, then … Who knows where it will end?\n\nI believe everyone has a story to tell, a potential book tucked away inside them, dying to get out. And all that's needed to create it, is a simple recipe: a pen and a notebook. So, open your mind and let your imagination roam through the endless possibilities it has to offer … then simply write!"

    "quote_credit": "Lothian",
    "quote": "In the realm of my soul, I believe him to be a great Ruler.",
    "paragraph_context": "Scotland: 1564",
    "preview": "Deep within the bowels of Elboru, it waits—an immense force—locked inside a sacred stone, destined to give its bearer the power to be a formidable Ruler. It belongs to just one—the Magus—Lord of all Warlocks—and he belongs to it. But the world of mortals has been overshadowed by a menace: an evil entity that would have it to dominate and destroy all that is good. And yet, all is not lost. From within this stone, a light is about to re-ignite by innocence, instilling hope into the hearts of those who would risk everything, to see it placed in the hands of the chosen one—to see it shine beyond the darkness.",
    "full_part_1": "Oran Shaw is no ordinary man: a Warlock, determined to leave his lengthy past behind, he disregards his elders, choosing to live a normal life among mortals … until he crosses paths with Kristene—a young, innocent woman, wrongfully accused of witchcraft. He feels compelled to rescue her from her death sentence. It is an act he would later regret.\n\nTogether, they flee to a new life, settling in Triora—Italy. But life alters when a sinister rival from Oran's past—Magia Nera, a dark Warlock—discovers them. He secretly manipulates Kristene, luring her away from Oran, bitterly ending their relationship. However, his interference eventually forces the three to go their separate ways.",
    "later": "Four decades later:",
    "full_part_2": "Oran has returned to Scotland, where he meets Rosalyn, a young widow with a baby. They marry and settle in the small village of Balloch, near the shores of Lac Lomond. At last, Oran feels content, living a normal and peaceful life with his new family. But when Rosalyn bears him a son, Gillis, life changes utterly for the reluctant Warlock.\n\nOran's past creeps up on him in the form of a Sorceress, named L'Ordana. He recognises her as Kristene, and there is an element of evil inside her. She is not alone and wants something from him: the location of a powerful amulet—the Shenn. Aware his son is destined to rule over the precious item, Oran vows to protect him … no matter what! Bound by duty, he is forced by his “council”—the Elliyan—to seek out the Sorceress and destroy her. Oran, however, is torn between their past and the present. But, when they come face to face, the Warlock unexpectedly finds himself as her prisoner.\n\nOver time, he allies with three unlikely characters, to help him escape; they are not what they seem. Half-human—half Vampire, the three Dhampir, Reece (a Soldier), Asai (a Samurai), and Tam (a Highlander), are also L'Ordana's prisoners—through no fault of their own. They, too, want freedom and their mortality restored. Therefore, Oran makes a bargain with them: in exchange for their freedom, they find and protect his son. With many lives at stake, and time running out, a twist of fate then turns the table on them all, when Reece makes a shocking discovery …"

    "p1": "Yes, it exists!\n\nMany people have asked me; “Why Scotland? And why Balloch?” Well, it was on my first trip there (around 2005) while visiting good friends, when I fell in love with the place. Always the perfect hosts, whenever I visit, Billy, Ciara and Megan are lucky to live a stone's throw from Balloch Castle, on the stunning shores of Loch Lomond (definitely worth a visit if you happen to be passing through). It is truly a beautiful location. And when the sun shines … Glorious! So, naturally, it inspired me to use it as the backdrop for The Sixth Amulet. It simply felt right. And, who knows, maybe I'll retire there … one day.",

    "p2": "Balloch was once a property of the Lennox family from the 11 th century, and it was in the 13 the century when the earls of Lennox built the old castle. However, the old castle was demolished by John Buchanan of Ardoch, in the 19 th century, and replaced by the present structure.\n\nBalloch was then purchased in 1915 by Glasgow City Corporation. Since 1980, the estate was designated as a country park, and since 2002 has been part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.\n\nBalloch is a category A listed building.\n\nYou can learn more about this beautiful castle and its equally beautiful surroundings at:",

  "history": {
    "title": "Out with the old, in with the new …",
    "p1": "On the 14 th of September 2021, I had my first novel - Beyond the Darkness - published through a US publisher (who shall remain nameless). However, a mere six weeks later, on the 24 th of October, the publisher slammed its doors abruptly on its authors, myself included. It was a terrible ordeal, and shock, to have this done to so many gifted authors, dampening our dreams, not to mention threatening our reputations. First impressions, and all that. Our only solace, however, was knowing that this happened through no fault of our own. Unfortunately, this has become a common practice throughout the publishing world. That said, there are still many good, genuine publishers out there.\n\n My novel - Beyond the Darkness (old cover on the right) had barely time to shine, and despite our ongoing attempts to claim any royalties due to us, and to have our books removed from bookselling platforms, our pleas fell on deaf ears. Then, to add insult to injury, I discovered, shortly after—and to my horror—that the UNEDITED version of my manuscript had been published; to have this happen to any author is simply heartbreaking, as well as potentially damaging. But, instead of wallowing in what happened (I wasn't the only victim), I dusted myself off and decided to republish (the edited version of my novel) myself. I chose to draw a line under the incident and move on. You've got to.\n\n Thankfully I still had my rights, and after seeking advice I gathered a trustworthy team together, including the same cover designer. Together, we reworked the cover (and title - The Sixth Amulet - Book One - Revised Edition) to create a richer, more stunning one, this time using the original illustration by illustrator Geraldine O'Malley. Also, had it not been for the support and extra help of others, especially the authors I now consider as friends, I'm not sure I would have been brave enough to move forward. But I won't dwell on that. What's the point?!\n\n And now, to say I'm even more excited and prouder of this 'Revised Edition' is an understatement!\n\n",
    "please_note": "PLEASE NOTE:\n\nThe original (old) cover (Beyond the Darkness) is now obsolete.",
    "p2": "Now, onto the new cover for The Sixth Amulet - Book One …\n\nI've been asked several times; 'Why a Kelpie?' Well, Kelvin (that's his name by the way) is quite symbolic to the story; had he not saved the life of one of my main characters, there would be no Kristene, no L'Ordana, no … Get the picture? Besides, when I first saw the illustration, I fell in love with it and simply had to have him on the cover.",
    "p3": "While I've not personally seen a 'live' one, I have, however, visited the Kelpies located between Falkirk and Grangemouth, in Scotland. The horse-head sculptures, created by artist Andy Scott, a graduate of the Glasgow School of Art, are mesmerizing! And big. VERY BIG!! Standing a majestic 30 metres high and weighing 300 tonnes, these imposing structures are breathtaking. Aside from representing the lineage of the heavy horse of Scottish industry (the Clydesdale) and economy, there is also the myth attached to the 'creatures'.",

    "p4": "Ah, yes, the beautiful mythical Kelpie, also known as the shape-shifting creature, is famous throughout many Scottish legends. As Kelpies often take the form of a horse, they are also known as 'water horses. But, beware! Should anyone try to mount one of these horse-like creatures, it will plunge into the murky waters, taking its rider with them to their death at the bottom of the loch.\n\n So, the next time you're in Scotland, taking a stroll along one of its many lochs, take heed; if you see a lone white or grey horse, turn the other way.\n\n",
